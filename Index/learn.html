The members of this organization subscribe to a way of life known as Opium. As defined by the Urban Dictionary, Opium is "edgy, emo, and very playboi carti core." I, myself, am a member of Directory-Social. Am I Opium? Well, I'll leave that up to you to decide. Thank you for visting this directory.</p>
